## About

I am a computer enthusiast, and I have continuously studied areas in IT that interest me. This has led me down all sorts of technical related paths. I enjoy using Linux and Windows to further my experience with both platforms. I have more recently been leaning heavily towards the Linux side in creating my home labs.

I enjoy spending time with my family, I have a wife named Jadrien and three dogs: Ella, Tesla, and Moxie. We love the outdoors and are commonly found hiking, walking our dogs, and playing disc golf.

The largest step in my career so far has been employment at Cerner and moving to Kansas City. This for the first time put me in the enterprise environment. I really enjoy working with the people I do and working on the projects that I have.
